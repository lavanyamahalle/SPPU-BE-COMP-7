> Each job is associated with a deadline and profit.
>

* **Dec 24:**

> a) You are given a set of tasks, each with a deadline and a penalty for missing the deadline. The objective is to schedule these tasks in a way that minimizes the total penalty incurred. However, you can only work on one task at a time, and once a task is started, it must be completed before moving on to the next task. Additionally, you can't start a task after its deadline has passed. Design a greedy algorithm to efficiently schedule these tasks to minimize the total penalty and prove its correctness.
